Write-Host "  1. Parse G-code command     (~1μs)"
Write-Host "  2. Add to motion buffer     (~2μs)"
Write-Host "  3. Call ProcessBuffer()     (~3μs)"
Write-Host "  4. Respond 'ok' immediately (~1μs)"

Write-Host "`nImproved Implementation:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "  1. Parse G-code command     (~1μs)"
Write-Host "  2. Add to motion buffer     (~2μs)"
Write-Host "  3. Call ProcessBuffer()     (~3μs)"

Write-Host "`nBenefits:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "  ✓ Motion planner has time to engage"
Write-Host "  ✓ Better synchronization with UGS"
Write-Host "  ✓ More predictable timing behavior"
Write-Host "  ✓ Still much faster than 8-bit systems (~16ms)"

Write-Host "`nCode Changes Applied:" -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "  ✓ G0/G1 motion commands: Added planner state check + delay"
Write-Host "  ✓ G2/G3 arc commands: Added planner state check + delay"
Write-Host "  ✓ G4 dwell commands: Added planner state check + delay"
Write-Host "  ✓ G28/G30 homing commands: Added planner state check + delay"
