Write-Host "BEFORE FIX - Problem Analysis:" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "• Commands parsed correctly ✅" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "• Motion detection working ✅" -ForegroundColor Green  
Write-Host "• Buffer head advancing (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) ✅" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "• Motion planner getting blocks ✅" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "• BUT tail stayed at 0 ❌" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "• AND position stayed 0.000,0.000,0.000 ❌" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "• AND steps stayed 0,0,0 ❌" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "• MotionPlanner_ExecuteBlock() was NEVER being called!" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "• Motion planner was getting blocks but not executing hardware motion" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "• Blocks accumulated in buffer but never processed" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "FIX APPLIED:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "• Added MotionPlanner_ExecuteBlock(current_motion_block) call" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "• Right after getting new block in MotionPlanner_UpdateTrajectory()" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "• This enables OCR modules and starts step pulse generation" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "• MotionBuffer_Complete() will advance tail pointer when motion finishes" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "EXPECTED RESULTS NOW:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "✅ head pointer should advance: 1,2,3,4..." -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "✅ tail pointer should advance: 0,1,2,3... (following head)" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "✅ Position should change: MPos:0.000,0.000,0.000 → MPos:X.XXX,Y.YYY,Z.ZZZ" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "✅ Steps should increment: Steps:0,0,0 → Steps:XXX,YYY,ZZZ" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "✅ OCR interrupts should fire and increment step counters" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "Build Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Ready for hardware testing with UGS!" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "Next Steps:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "1. Flash firmware to PIC32MZ hardware" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "2. Connect to UGS and run the square G-code file" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "3. Monitor status reports for:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   • Advancing tail pointer" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "   • Changing position values" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "   • Incrementing step counts" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "   • '[DEBUG: Motion planner got new block]' messages" -ForegroundColor Gray
