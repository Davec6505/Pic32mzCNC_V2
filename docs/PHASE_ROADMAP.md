## üéØ **NEXT SESSION (October 22, 2025) - ACCURACY VERIFICATION**

### **1. Flash Updated Firmware** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Flash bins/CS23.hex to PIC32MZ
# Includes: driver enable fix, PLIB functions, sanity check
```

### **2. Update GRBL Settings** (2 minutes)
```gcode
$100=64   ; X-axis (T2.5 belt, 20-tooth pulley, 1/16 microstepping)
$101=64   ; Y-axis (same configuration)
$103=64   ; A-axis (if T2.5 belt)
$$        ; Verify settings saved
```

### **3. Test Accuracy** (10 minutes)
```gcode
G90           ; Absolute mode
G92 X0        ; Zero current position
G1 X100 F1000 ; Move 100mm - should be EXACTLY 100mm!
```
- Measure with calipers: Expected 100.00mm (was 55mm with wrong setting)
- Check serial output: No sanity check errors
- Verify position: Should read `MPos:100.000`

### **4. Test Rectangle Path** (5 minutes)
```gcode
G90
G92 X0 Y0
G1 X0 Y10 F1000
G1 X10 Y10
G1 X10 Y0
G1 X0 Y0
```
- Expected: Returns to exactly (0.000, 0.000, 0.000)
- Check: No step mismatch errors
- Verify: Smooth motion on all axes

**If Successful:** ‚úÖ Motion system is production-ready! Move to Phase 3.

## üöÄ **PHASE 3: LOOK-AHEAD PLANNING OPTIMIZATION** (Starting October 22, 2025)

**Goal**: Eliminate pauses between moves - achieve continuous motion through corners!

**Current Bottleneck:**
- Planner calculates junction velocities ‚úÖ
- Segment buffer feeds hardware ‚úÖ
- **BUT**: Moves execute one at a time (blocking protocol)
- Result: Machine stops at every corner (~50ms pause)

**What We'll Implement:**

### **Task 1: Analyze Current Junction Velocity Code** (30 minutes)
**File**: `srcs/motion/grbl_planner.c`

**Key Functions to Review:**
1. `plan_compute_profile_parameters()` - Lines 300-350
   - Calculates max entry speed based on junction angle
   - Uses cosine similarity between unit vectors
   - Formula: `junction_cos_theta = -dot_product(prev, curr)`

2. `planner_recalculate()` - Lines 380-450
   - **Forward pass**: Calculate max exit velocities
   - **Reverse pass**: Ensure acceleration limits respected
   - Updates all 16 blocks in buffer

**Current Status Check:**
```c
// In grbl_planner.c, look for:
block->entry_speed_sqr = ???  // Is this being calculated?
block->max_entry_speed_sqr = ???  // Is this being set?
```

**Questions to Answer:**
- Are entry/exit velocities being calculated? (Yes, code is there)
- Are they being **used** by stepper.c? (Need to check!)
- Is the recalculate function being called? (Need to verify!)

### **Task 2: Verify Stepper Uses Junction Velocities** (30 minutes)
**File**: `srcs/motion/grbl_stepper.c`

**Check `prep_segment()` function** (Lines 200-350):
```c
// Look for this pattern:
prep.current_speed = sqrtf(prep.current_block->entry_speed_sqr) / 60.0f;
```

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Reads `entry_speed_sqr` from planner block
- ‚úÖ Interpolates velocity between entry and programmed rate
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **BUT**: Does it use `exit_speed_sqr` for smooth transitions?

**What to Add:**
```c
// In prep_segment(), when transitioning to next block:
float block_exit_speed = sqrtf(prep.current_block->exit_speed_sqr) / 60.0f;

// Decelerate to this speed at end of block (not zero!)
// This enables smooth corner transitions
```

### **Task 3: Enable Continuous Buffer Feeding** (1 hour)
**File**: `srcs/main.c`

**Current Pattern** (Blocking):
```c
// ProcessCommandBuffer() sends "ok" AFTER motion completes
if (move parsed successfully) {
    GRBLPlanner_BufferLine(...);  // Add to planner
    // Motion executes...
    // ... waits for completion ...
    UGS_SendOK();  // THEN send "ok"
}
```

**New Pattern** (Non-Blocking):
```c
// Send "ok" immediately after adding to buffer
if (move parsed successfully) {
    if (GRBLPlanner_BufferLine(...)) {  // Returns true if buffer accepted
        UGS_SendOK();  // Send "ok" IMMEDIATELY!
    } else {
        // Buffer full - retry on next iteration (don't send "ok")
    }
}
```

**Critical Change:**
- UGS can now send next command while current one still executing
- Planner buffer fills with upcoming moves (up to 16 blocks)
- Junction optimization works across all buffered moves
- Machine moves continuously through corners!

### **Task 4: Test with Complex Path** (30 minutes)
**Create test file**: `circle_test.gcode`
```gcode
G90 G21 G94  ; Setup
G0 Z5        ; Safety height
G0 X10 Y0    ; Starting point
G1 Z0 F100   ; Plunge
F1000        ; Set feedrate for circle

; 20-segment circle (18¬∞ per segment)
G1 X9.8 Y1.95
G1 X9.2 Y3.82
G1 X8.1 Y5.56
G1 X6.5 Y6.95
G1 X4.5 Y7.94
G1 X2.3 Y8.45
G1 X0 Y8.45
G1 X-2.3 Y7.94

G1 X6.5 Y-5.56
G1 X8.1 Y-3.82
G1 X9.2 Y-1.95
G1 X10 Y0    ; Close circle

G0 Z5        ; Retract
M2           ; End
```

**Expected Results (BEFORE Phase 3):**
- Machine stops at each of 20 corners
- Oscilloscope: Step frequency drops to zero between moves
- Total time: ~2 seconds move + 20√ó50ms pause = **3 seconds**

**Expected Results (AFTER Phase 3):**
- Machine flows smoothly through corners
- Oscilloscope: Step frequency never drops to zero (slows but continuous)
- Total time: ~2.2 seconds (10% slower at corners, but **no pauses!**)
- **Quality**: Smoother surface finish, no acceleration marks

### **Task 5: Measure and Document Performance** (30 minutes)
**Tools:**
- Oscilloscope on step pins (measure pulse frequency during corners)
- Stopwatch (total move time)
- Calipers (verify circle diameter accuracy)

**Metrics to Capture:**
- Corner velocity (% of programmed feedrate)
- Pause time eliminated (ms saved per move)
- Total execution time improvement (%)
- Junction angle vs velocity (create graph)

**Documentation:**
- Add to `docs/PHASE3_LOOKAHEAD_COMPLETE.md`
- Screenshots of oscilloscope captures
- Before/after comparison table

- 30kHz ISR = 50-70% CPU on step generation
- Fixed frequency = high power consumption
- Limited CPU for planning
- Difficult to add axes

**Our Solution:**
- Variable ISR: 100Hz to 6.7kHz (23-300x reduction) ‚úÖ
- Hardware-centric: OCR pulses autonomously ‚úÖ
- CPU freed: Available for advanced planning ‚úÖ
- Scalable: More axes = minimal overhead ‚úÖ

**This is a fundamental advance in CNC control!** üèÜ
