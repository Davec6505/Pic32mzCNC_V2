# Quick Reference - October 19, 2025 End of Day

## System Status
- ‚úÖ Serial communication: WORKING
- ‚úÖ G-code parsing: WORKING  
- ‚úÖ Command buffer: WORKING (16x per loop)
- ‚úÖ Zero-step filtering: WORKING
- ‚ùå Motion execution: INCOMPLETE (needs ExecuteMotion() drain loop)

## What to Do Tomorrow Morning

### 1. Open main.c and Find ExecuteMotion()
Location: `srcs/main.c` around line 470

### 2. Replace Single Dequeue with Drain Loop
**Current code** (WRONG):
```c
if (!MultiAxis_IsBusy() && MotionBuffer_HasData())
{
  motion_block_t block;
  if (MotionBuffer_GetNext(&block)) {
    // Execute ONE block only
    MultiAxis_ExecuteCoordinatedMove(block.steps);
  }
}
```

**New code** (CORRECT):
```c
/* Drain ALL available blocks when machine is idle */
while (!MultiAxis_IsBusy() && MotionBuffer_HasData())
{
  motion_block_t block;
  if (MotionBuffer_GetNext(&block))
  {
    /* Skip zero-step blocks */
    bool has_steps = (block.steps[AXIS_X] != 0) || 
                     (block.steps[AXIS_Y] != 0) ||
                     (block.steps[AXIS_Z] != 0) || 
                     (block.steps[AXIS_A] != 0);
    
    if (has_steps) {
      MultiAxis_ExecuteCoordinatedMove(block.steps);
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Build and Test
```powershell
make all
# Flash bins/CS23.hex to board
# Open UGS, connect to COM4
# Run: G21, G90, G0Z5, G1Y10, G1X10, G1Y0, G1X0
# Expected: Position returns to (0,0,5)
# Current: Position stops at (10,10,5) ‚Üê Bug to fix
```

### 4. Verify Debug Output
Should see:
```
[EXEC] Steps: X=0 Y=800 Z=0      ‚Üê G1 Y10
[EXEC] Steps: X=800 Y=0 Z=0      ‚Üê G1 X10
[EXEC] Steps: X=0 Y=-800 Z=0     ‚Üê G1 Y0 (NEW!)
[EXEC] Steps: X=-800 Y=0 Z=0     ‚Üê G1 X0 (NEW!)
<Idle|MPos:0.000,0.000,5.xxx|...> ‚Üê Final position (FIXED!)
```

### 5. After Successful Test
- Remove `#define DEBUG_MOTION_BUFFER` from main.c and motion_buffer.c
- Rebuild production firmware
- Test complex patterns
- Update documentation

## Key Files
- **srcs/main.c** - Main loop with ExecuteMotion() (line 470)
- **srcs/motion/motion_buffer.c** - Zero-step filtering (line 127)
- **docs/MOTION_EXECUTION_DEBUG_OCT19.md** - Full debug session
- **docs/SUMMARY_OCT19_2025.md** - End of day summary

## Quick Commands
```powershell
# Build
make all

# Flash (via MPLAB X IPE)
# File: bins/CS23.hex

# Monitor serial (PowerShell)
$port = new-Object System.IO.Ports.SerialPort COM4,115200,None,8,one
$port.Open()
$port.WriteLine("?")
$port.ReadLine()
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
| Command | Current Position | Expected  | Actual (Before Fix) |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| G1 Y10  | (0,10,5)         | ‚úÖ Works   | ‚úÖ Works             |
| G1 X10  | (10,10,5)        | ‚úÖ Works   | ‚úÖ Works             |
| G1 Y0   | (10,0,5)         | ‚ùå Missing | ‚ùå Not executed      |
| G1 X0   | (0,0,5)          | ‚ùå Missing | ‚ùå Not executed      |

After fix, all 4 commands should execute and machine returns to origin.

## Why This Fix Works

**Problem**: ExecuteMotion() dequeues one block, starts motion, returns. By the time main loop comes back around, machine is already busy executing that block, so ExecuteMotion() returns immediately without dequeuing next block.

**Solution**: Use `while` loop to keep dequeuing blocks as long as machine is idle AND buffer has data. This ensures motion buffer drains completely before control returns to command processing.

**Side effect**: Machine will execute all queued moves in rapid succession (good for continuous motion). Later we can add look-ahead planning to optimize velocities between moves.

**Confidence Level**: üü¢ HIGH - This should fix the issue!
