# PlantUML Documentation Update - Phase 1 Complete

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**  
**Scope**: Updated architecture diagrams to reflect Phase 1 completion

---

## Overview

The PlantUML documentation has been updated to accurately reflect the **Phase 1 completed architecture** after successful GRBL integration and hardware verification. Two new comprehensive diagrams were created, and the README was updated with completion status and recommended viewing order.

## New Diagrams Created

### 1. **`13_phase1_complete_dataflow.puml`** ‚≠ê PRIMARY DIAGRAM

**Purpose**: Complete 6-stage data flow from serial reception to hardware pulse generation

**Key Sections**:
- ‚úÖ **Stage 1: Serial Reception** (UART2 @ 115200, ISR ring buffer, 512 bytes)
- ‚úÖ **Stage 2: G-Code Parser** (GRBL v1.1f, modal position merge logic)
- ‚úÖ **Stage 3: GRBL Planner** (16-block buffer, junction deviation, look-ahead)
- ‚úÖ **Stage 4: Motion Manager** (TMR9 @ 100Hz, direction bit conversion, position tracking)
- ‚úÖ **Stage 5: S-Curve Controller** (TMR1 @ 1kHz, 7-segment profiles, axis deactivation)
- ‚úÖ **Stage 6: Hardware Layer** (OCR dual-compare PWM, DRV8825 drivers)

**Critical Features Documented**:
- Real-time command handling (?, !, ~, ^X)
- Feedback loops (step counts ‚Üí position updates ‚Üí status queries)
- Modal position merge (unspecified axes retain previous values)
- Direction bit conversion (GRBL unsigned + bits ‚Üí signed steps)
- Single-axis deactivation (prevents diagonal drift)
- Interrupt priority architecture (UART @5, OCR @3, TMR1 @2, TMR9 @1)

**Legend Includes**:
- Phase 1 completion checklist with all features marked ‚úÖ
- Hardware test results (square pattern verification)
- Interrupt priority rationale
- Phase 2 roadmap teaser

**Size**: ~450 lines of PlantUML code  
**Estimated render time**: 10-15 seconds (complex diagram with feedback loops)

### 2. **`14_phase1_system_overview.puml`** ‚≠ê SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

**Purpose**: High-level system architecture with all Phase 1 components and status

**Key Packages**:
1. **Hardware Layer** (PIC32MZ, DRV8825, NEMA 23, UART2, limit switches)
2. **Hardware Abstraction Layer** (TMR1, OCR, GPIO, UART ISR, EVIC)
3. **Motion Subsystem** (motion_types.h, motion_math.c, multiaxis_control.c, motion_manager.c)
4. **GRBL Planner** (grbl_planner.c, grbl_plan_block_t, 16-block buffer)
5. **Application Layer** (main.c, gcode_parser.c, ugs_interface.c, serial_wrapper.c, command_buffer.c)

**Critical Annotations**:
- All packages marked with completion status (‚úÖ COMPLETE / ‚úÖ VERIFIED)
- Interrupt priority notes on each component
- Feedback loops color-coded by purpose (red=steps, blue=complete, green=position, purple=status)
- Three-stage pipeline explanation (ProcessSerialRx ‚Üí ProcessCommandBuffer ‚Üí ExecuteMotion)

**Legend Includes**:
- Phase 1 completion table by component
- Critical fixes summary (modal merge, direction conversion, position tracking, axis deactivation)
- Hardware test results (square pattern, repeatability, accuracy)
- Architecture highlights (time-based interpolation, hardware pulse generation, non-blocking protocol)
- Phase 2 preview (stepper.c integration, segment buffer)

**Size**: ~380 lines of PlantUML code  
**Estimated render time**: 8-12 seconds

## README.md Updates

### Added Sections:

**1. Phase 1 Completion Banner** (Top of file):
```markdown
**Phase 1 Complete!** üéâ (October 19, 2025)

### Critical Achievements:
- ‚úÖ GRBL v1.1f Integration: Full parser with 13 modal groups
- ‚úÖ Look-Ahead Planning: Junction deviation + velocity optimization
- ‚úÖ Position Tracking Fix: Absolute position array
- ‚úÖ Modal Position Merge: Unspecified axes preserve previous values
...

### Hardware Verification (October 19, 2025):
Test Pattern: G1 Y10 X10 Y0 X0 (10mm square)
Result: Returns to (0,0,0) perfectly ‚úÖ
```

**2. Recommended Diagram Order**:
- Prioritizes new Phase 1 diagrams (13 & 14)
- Marks original diagrams as "Historical Reference"
- Warns that old diagrams show Phase 0 architecture

**3. Obsolete Diagram Annotations**:
- `01_system_overview.puml` ‚Üí "outdated - see 14"
- `02_data_flow.puml` ‚Üí "outdated - see 13"
- `04_motion_buffer.puml` ‚Üí "obsolete - replaced by GRBL planner"

---

## Why These Updates Matter

### **1. Accurate Baseline for Phase 2**

Phase 2 will integrate GRBL's stepper.c (segment-based execution). Having accurate Phase 1 diagrams creates a clear "before" snapshot for comparison when:
- Replacing TMR1 @ 1kHz with GRBL's segment buffer
- Integrating stepper interrupt patterns
- Debugging integration issues

### **2. Prevents Confusion for Future Development**

Old diagrams showed "Motion Buffer" approach with `MotionBuffer_Add()` / `MotionBuffer_GetNext()`. The actual code uses GRBL planner with `GRBLPlanner_BufferLine()` / `GetCurrentBlock()`. Without updates, developers would:
- Reference wrong APIs in new code
- Look for files that don't exist (motion_buffer.c is present but unused)
- Misunderstand the actual data flow

### **3. Documents Critical Fixes**

Four major bugs were fixed in Phase 1:
1. Modal position merge (unspecified axes)
2. Direction bit conversion (GRBL ‚Üí signed)
3. Position tracking (machine_position[] array)
4. Single-axis deactivation (diagonal drift)

These fixes are now **visually documented** with notes, color-coded sections, and explicit callouts. Future debugging can reference these diagrams to understand why certain patterns exist.

### **4. Hardware Verification Record**

The diagrams include **actual test results** (square pattern, position accuracy, repeatability). This creates a benchmark for future testing:
- Regression testing can compare against documented baseline
- Performance improvements can be quantified
- Hardware changes can be evaluated against known-good state

## Diagram Viewing Recommendations

### **For New Developers**:
1. Start with `14_phase1_system_overview.puml` (big picture)
2. Deep dive with `13_phase1_complete_dataflow.puml` (detailed flow)
3. Reference `12_timer_architecture.puml` (hardware timing)

### **For Debugging**:
1. Identify which stage the bug occurs in using `13_phase1_complete_dataflow.puml`
2. Check feedback loops (colored dashed lines) for data flow issues
3. Verify interrupt priorities if timing-related

### **For Phase 2 Planning**:
1. Review `14_phase1_system_overview.puml` to identify integration points
2. Check "Next Phase" section in legends for transition strategy
3. Compare with GRBL's architecture diagrams (if available)

3. Add module dependency diagram showing GRBL integration

### **Medium Priority**:
4. Create sequence diagram for real-time command flow (?, !, ~, ^X)
5. Create state diagram for GRBL planner block lifecycle
6. Update module dependency diagram (`03_module_dependencies.puml`)

### **Low Priority**:
7. Create timing diagram for OCR dual-compare pattern
8. Create activity diagram for three-stage pipeline
9. Archive Phase 0 diagrams to `docs/plantuml/archive/` folder
