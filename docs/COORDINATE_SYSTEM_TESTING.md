## Build Status

**Firmware Built Successfully**: `make all` completed with no errors  
**Hex File**: `bins/CS23.hex` ready for flashing  
**Code Changes**: 7 files modified, ~400 lines added

## Testing Procedure

### Prerequisites

1. **Flash firmware**: `bins/CS23.hex` to PIC32MZ board
2. **Connect via UGS**: COM4 @ 115200 baud
3. **Home machine**: Move to known position (e.g., X=0 Y=0 Z=5)
4. **Clear offsets**: Send `G92.1` to ensure clean start

### Test 1: G92 Basic Functionality

**Objective**: Verify G92 coordinate offset works correctly

```gcode
?                    ; Check current position (note MPos values)
G92 X0 Y0 Z0         ; Set current position as work zero
?                    ; WPos should show 0.000,0.000,0.000
G1 Y10 F1000         ; Move 10mm in Y axis
?                    ; Should show WPos:0.000,10.000,0.000
                     ; MPos should be original_Y + 10
G1 X10               ; Move 10mm in X axis
?                    ; Should show WPos:10.000,10.000,0.000
G1 Y0                ; Return to Y=0 in work coordinates
?                    ; Should show WPos:10.000,0.000,0.000
G1 X0                ; Return to X=0 in work coordinates
?                    ; Should show WPos:0.000,0.000,0.000
                     ; Should be back at G92 zero position!
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ After G92: WPos shows 0,0,0 even though MPos is unchanged
- ✅ G1 Y10 moves 10mm (actual physical motion!)
- ✅ Returning to X0 Y0 brings steppers back to G92 zero point
- ✅ MPos remains consistent with physical position
- ✅ WPos reflects offsets applied

**Failure Modes** (from previous bug):
- ❌ No motion after G92 → Offsets not applied in motion planner
- ❌ Wrong distance → Coordinate conversion error
- ❌ WPos not updating → Status report not using MotionMath_GetWorkPosition()

### Test 2: G92 Offset Calculation

**Objective**: Verify G92 calculates offset correctly

```gcode
G90                  ; Absolute mode
G0 X20 Y20           ; Move to (20,20) in machine coordinates
?                    ; Note MPos (should be near 20,20)
G92 X5 Y5            ; Set current position as (5,5) in work coordinates
?                    ; WPos should show 5.000,5.000
                     ; MPos should be unchanged (still ~20,20)
$#                   ; View coordinate parameters
                     ; [G92:15.000,15.000,0.000,0.000]
                     ; Offset = MPos - WPos = 20-5 = 15 ✓
G1 X0 Y0 F1000       ; Move to work zero
?                    ; WPos should show 0.000,0.000
                     ; MPos should show 15.000,15.000 (moved to MPos=15)
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ G92 X5 Y5 makes current position (20,20) appear as (5,5)
- ✅ Offset calculated as: current_work_pos - commanded_value = 20-5 = 15
- ✅ $# shows [G92:15.000,15.000,0.000,0.000]
- ✅ Moving to X0 Y0 goes to machine position (15,15)

### Test 3: G92.1 Clear Offset

**Objective**: Verify G92.1 clears offset

```gcode
G92 X0 Y0            ; Set offset
?                    ; WPos should differ from MPos
$#                   ; Should show non-zero G92 offset
G92.1                ; Clear offset
?                    ; WPos should now match MPos
$#                   ; Should show [G92:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000]
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ After G92.1: WPos = MPos
- ✅ $# shows zero offset
- ✅ Motion works normally in machine coordinates

### Test 4: $# Command Output

**Objective**: Verify $# command shows all coordinate parameters

```gcode
$#                   ; Should display:
                     ; [G54:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000]
                     ; [G55:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000]
                     ; [G56:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000]
                     ; [G57:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000]
                     ; [G58:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000]
                     ; [G59:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000]
                     ; [G28:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000]
                     ; [G30:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000]
                     ; [G92:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000]
                     ; [TLO:0.000]
                     ; [PRB:0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000:0]
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All coordinate systems displayed
- ✅ Format matches GRBL v1.1f specification
- ✅ Values update after G92 commands

### Test 5: Square Pattern (Original Problem)

**Objective**: Verify original 10mm square issue is fixed

```gcode
G90                  ; Absolute mode
G0 X0 Y0             ; Move to machine zero
G92 X0 Y0            ; Set work zero
G1 Y10 F1000         ; Move to Y=10
?                    ; Verify WPos:0.000,10.000
G1 X10               ; Move to X=10, Y=10
?                    ; Verify WPos:10.000,10.000
G1 Y0                ; Move to X=10, Y=0
?                    ; Verify WPos:10.000,0.000
G1 X0                ; Return to origin
?                    ; Verify WPos:0.000,0.000
```

**Measurements**:
- Use oscilloscope on step/dir pins
- Verify Y-axis moves EXACTLY 800 steps (10mm × 80 steps/mm)
- Verify X-axis moves EXACTLY 800 steps
- Measure actual distance with calipers: should be 10.000mm ± 0.1mm

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Each side of square is 10mm (not 8.225mm!)
- ✅ Motion is square, not diagonal
- ✅ Returns to exact starting position
- ✅ No accumulated position error

### Test 6: Continuous Motion (Phase 2 Protocol)

**Objective**: Verify non-blocking protocol enables smooth motion

```gcode
G90
G0 X0 Y0
G92 X0 Y0
G1 Y10 F1000         ; Send these rapidly
G1 X10               ; Don't wait for completion
G1 Y20               ; UGS should queue them
G1 X20               ; Motion should be continuous
G1 Y30
G1 X30
G1 Y0
G1 X0
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ UGS sends commands rapidly (non-blocking)
- ✅ Motion buffer queues commands
- ✅ Steppers move continuously (no stops between moves)
- ✅ Status reports show position updating
- ✅ "ok" responses sent immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: No Motion After G92

**Symptom**: Sending G1 commands after G92 produces no stepper movement

**Cause**: Motion buffer not applying coordinate offsets

**Check**:
1. Verify `plan_buffer_line()` calls `MotionMath_WorkToMachine()`
2. Check that delta is calculated: `target_steps - current_steps`
3. Confirm `MultiAxis_GetStepCount()` returns valid position

**Fix**: Code already updated in this implementation ✓

### Problem: WPos Not Updating

**Symptom**: Status report shows same WPos after G92

**Cause**: Status handler not using `MotionMath_GetWorkPosition()`

**Check**:
1. Verify `handle_control_char(GCODE_CTRL_STATUS_REPORT)` updated
2. Confirm calls to `MotionMath_GetMachinePosition()` and `MotionMath_GetWorkPosition()`

**Fix**: Code already updated in this implementation ✓

### Problem: Wrong Offset in $#

**Symptom**: $# shows incorrect G92 offset

**Cause**: G92 handler not calculating offset correctly

**Check**:
1. Verify formula: `offset = current_work_pos - commanded_value`
2. Check that `MotionMath_SetG92Offset()` is called
3. Confirm `modal_state.g92_offset` is synchronized

**Fix**: Code already updated in this implementation ✓

## Future Work (Not in This Implementation)

### G54-G59 Command Handlers (Storage Ready, Commands Pending)

**Add to gcode_parser.c**:
```c
static bool GCode_HandleWorkCoordinateSystem(uint8_t g_command)
{
    // G54=0, G55=1, ..., G59=5
    uint8_t wcs = g_command - 54;
    MotionMath_SetActiveWCS(wcs);
    modal_state.active_wcs = wcs;
    return true;
}
```

### G10 L2/L20 Command Handlers

**Add to gcode_parser.c**:
```c
static bool GCode_HandleG10_SetOffset(const gcode_line_t *tokenized_line)
{
    float l_value, p_value;
    bool has_l = GCode_FindToken(tokenized_line, 'L', &l_value);
    bool has_p = GCode_FindToken(tokenized_line, 'P', &p_value);
    
    if (!has_l || !has_p) return false;
    
    uint8_t wcs = (uint8_t)p_value - 1;  // P1=G54, P2=G55, etc.
    
    if ((int)l_value == 2) {
        // G10 L2 - Set work offset directly
        float offsets[NUM_AXES];
        GCode_FindToken(tokenized_line, 'X', &offsets[AXIS_X]);
        GCode_FindToken(tokenized_line, 'Y', &offsets[AXIS_Y]);
        GCode_FindToken(tokenized_line, 'Z', &offsets[AXIS_Z]);
        MotionMath_SetWorkOffset(wcs, offsets);
    } else if ((int)l_value == 20) {
        // G10 L20 - Set work offset to current position
        float offsets[NUM_AXES];
        for (axis_id_t axis = AXIS_X; axis < NUM_AXES; axis++) {
            offsets[axis] = MotionMath_GetMachinePosition(axis);
        }
        MotionMath_SetWorkOffset(wcs, offsets);
    }
    return true;
}
```

### G28/G30 Command Integration

**Update existing handlers in gcode_parser.c** to use coordinate system:
```c
static bool GCode_HandleG28_ReturnHome(const gcode_line_t *tokenized_line)
{
    // Move to G28 predefined position (in machine coordinates)
    float target[NUM_AXES];
    for (axis_id_t axis = AXIS_X; axis < NUM_AXES; axis++) {
        target[axis] = MotionMath_GetPredefinedPosition(0, axis);
    }
    // Convert to parsed_move_t and execute...
}
```
