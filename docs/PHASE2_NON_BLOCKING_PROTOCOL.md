# Phase 2: Non-Blocking Protocol Implementation

## Date: October 17, 2025

## Overview
Transitioned from **GRBL Simple Send-Response (Phase 1)** to **GRBL Character-Counting Protocol (Phase 2)** to enable continuous motion with look-ahead planning.

---

## Problem with Phase 1 (Blocking Protocol)

### Architecture
```c
// Phase 1 - Blocking (OLD)
if (MotionBuffer_Add(&move)) {
    while (MultiAxis_IsBusy() || MotionBuffer_HasData()) {
        // Wait for motion to complete...
    }
    UGS_SendOK();  // ← Blocks until ALL motion done!
}
```

### Issues
- ❌ **Motion stops between moves** - Buffer empties while waiting for "ok"
- ❌ **Serial latency waste** - Round-trip delay (10-50ms) per command
- ❌ **No look-ahead possible** - Only 1 move in buffer at a time
- ❌ **Jerky cornering** - Machine decelerates to zero at every vertex
- ❌ **Slow program execution** - Can't pre-buffer commands

### Expected Behavior (Phase 1)
```
Host: G1 X10 F1000
Controller: [executes... waits... motion complete]
Controller: ok
Host: G1 X20 F1000  ← Can't send until first move done!
```

**Result**: Motion pauses between moves (correct for Phase 1, but inefficient)

---

## Solution: Phase 2 (Non-Blocking Protocol)

### New Architecture
```c
// Phase 2 - Non-Blocking (NEW)
if (MotionBuffer_Add(&move)) {
    /* Buffer accepted - send ok immediately (non-blocking) */
    UGS_SendOK();  // ← Returns instantly!
}
else {
    /* Buffer full - DON'T send "ok" per GRBL protocol
     * Host will wait and retry command automatically */
    /* Silently drop command - UGS will handle retry */
}
```

### Benefits
- ✅ **Continuous motion** - Buffer fills with 16 commands
- ✅ **No serial latency** - Commands stream in while motion executes
- ✅ **Look-ahead planning ready** - 16 moves available for optimization
- ✅ **Smooth cornering** - Junction velocity optimization possible
- ✅ **Fast program execution** - No waiting for motion to complete

### Expected Behavior (Phase 2)
```
Host: G1 X10 F1000     (ok received immediately, buffer: 15/16 free)
Host: G1 X20 F1000     (ok received immediately, buffer: 14/16 free)
Host: G1 X30 F1000     (ok received immediately, buffer: 13/16 free)
...
Controller: [all moves execute continuously with smooth cornering]
```

**Result**: Motion flows smoothly, no stops between moves!

---

## Flow Control Mechanism

### Buffer Full Condition
```c
if (MotionBuffer_Add(&move)) {
    UGS_SendOK();  // ← Buffer accepted
}
else {
    // ← Buffer full - NO "ok" sent
    // UGS will wait and retry automatically
}
```

### How UGS Handles Buffer Full
1. **UGS sends command**: `G1 X10 F1000\n`
2. **No "ok" received**: UGS waits (timeout ~200ms)
3. **UGS retries**: Resends same command
4. **Motion buffer drains**: Space becomes available
5. **Buffer accepts**: Controller sends "ok"
6. **UGS continues**: Sends next command

**CRITICAL**: This is **standard GRBL behavior** - UGS is designed for this flow!

## Code Changes

### 1. Main.c - Removed Blocking Wait

**File**: `srcs/main.c`  
**Lines**: 185-226

**OLD (Phase 1)**:
```c
if (MotionBuffer_Add(&move))
{
    /* Poll until motion buffer is empty and controller is idle */
    while (MultiAxis_IsBusy() || MotionBuffer_HasData())
    {
        APP_Tasks();
        SYS_Tasks();
    }
    
    /* Motion complete - now send "ok" to allow next command */
    UGS_SendOK();  // ← BLOCKING!
}
```

**NEW (Phase 2)**:
```c
if (MotionBuffer_Add(&move))
{
    /* GRBL Character-Counting Protocol (Phase 2 - Non-Blocking)
     * Send "ok" immediately after adding to motion buffer.
     * Motion executes in background via ExecuteMotion() in main loop.
     */
    UGS_SendOK();  // ← NON-BLOCKING!
}
else
{
    /* Buffer full - DON'T send "ok" per GRBL protocol */
    /* UGS will wait and retry automatically */
}
```

### 2. Copilot-Instructions.md - Updated Status

**File**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**Updates**:
- Status: Phase 1 → **Phase 2 ACTIVE**
- Protocol: "Simple Send-Response" → **"Character-Counting Protocol"**
- Benefits: "Blocking wait" → **"Continuous motion with look-ahead ready"**
- TODO: Moved Phase 2 items to Phase 3 (look-ahead implementation)

## Testing Plan

### Phase 2 Verification Tests

#### 1. **Non-Blocking Behavior Test**
```gcode
G90
G1 X10 Y10 F1000
G1 X20 Y20 F1000
G1 X30 Y30 F1000
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ UGS receives "ok" immediately for each command (no wait)
- ✅ Commands sent rapidly (no 100ms pause between moves)
- ✅ Motion buffer fills with all 3 moves
- ✅ Motion executes continuously (no stops between vertices)

**Verify with UGS Console**:
```
>>> G1 X10 Y10 F1000
ok  ← Received instantly!
>>> G1 X20 Y20 F1000
ok  ← Received instantly!
```

#### 2. **Buffer Full Test**
Send 20+ moves rapidly to fill 16-block buffer:

```gcode
G90
G1 X10 F1000
G1 X20 F1000
G1 X30 F1000
... (20 total moves)
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ First 16 moves accepted immediately
- ✅ Moves 17-20 delayed (buffer full, no "ok")
- ✅ UGS retries moves 17-20 automatically
- ✅ All moves execute eventually (no errors)

#### 3. **Continuous Motion Test**
Draw a square (4 corners = 4 junctions):

```gcode
G90
G0 X0 Y0 F3000
G1 X50 Y0 F1000
G1 X50 Y50 F1000
G1 X0 Y50 F1000
G1 X0 Y0 F1000
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ No stops at corners (continuous motion)
- ✅ Oscilloscope shows velocity doesn't reach zero between moves
- ✅ Total time < blocking protocol (reduced serial latency)

**Current Behavior (Phase 2 without look-ahead)**:
- ⚠️ Machine MAY still slow down at corners (no junction optimization yet)
- ⚠️ This is OK - Phase 3 will implement full look-ahead planning
- ✅ Motion is still continuous (no complete stops)

#### 4. **Real-Time Command Test**
```gcode
G1 X100 F500  ; Start long move
!             ; Feed hold (should pause immediately)
?             ; Status query
~             ; Cycle start (should resume)
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Feed hold works immediately (even with buffer full)
- ✅ Status report shows "Hold" state
- ✅ Resume continues motion from paused position

## Architecture Implications

### Main Loop Pattern (Unchanged)
```c
int main(void)
{
    SYS_Initialize(NULL);
    UGS_Initialize();
    GCode_Initialize();
    MotionBuffer_Initialize();
    MultiAxis_Initialize();
    APP_Initialize();

    while (true)
    {
        ProcessGCode();      // ← Adds moves to buffer (non-blocking now!)
        ExecuteMotion();     // ← Drains buffer (executes moves in background)
        APP_Tasks();
        SYS_Tasks();
    }
}
```

**Key**: `ProcessGCode()` no longer blocks! Motion happens in parallel via `ExecuteMotion()`.

### Motion Buffer State Machine
```
Empty Buffer (count=0)
    ↓ MotionBuffer_Add() [non-blocking]
Buffer Has Data (count=1-15)
    ↓ ExecuteMotion() [dequeues and executes]
Controller Busy (motion active)
    ↓ MultiAxis_IsBusy() → false
Idle (ready for next move)
    ↓ Loop continues...
```

**Flow**: Commands fill buffer → ExecuteMotion() drains buffer → Continuous cycle

---

## Performance Comparison

### Phase 1 (Blocking)
```
Command 1: Send → Wait 100ms (motion) → "ok" → Repeat
Command 2: Send → Wait 100ms (motion) → "ok" → Repeat
Total: 200ms for 2 moves
```

### Phase 2 (Non-Blocking)
```
Command 1: Send → "ok" (instant)
Command 2: Send → "ok" (instant)
Both motions execute in parallel → Total: 100ms for 2 moves
```

**Speedup**: ~2x faster execution (eliminates serial latency)

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

### Look-Ahead Planning Implementation

**Current State (Phase 2)**:
- ✅ Motion buffer accepts commands non-blocking
- ✅ 16-block buffer provides look-ahead window
- ⚠️ No junction velocity optimization (machines may slow at corners)
- ⚠️ All moves use max feedrate (no velocity planning)

**Phase 3 Goal**:
Implement full look-ahead planning in `MotionBuffer_RecalculateAll()`:

```c
void MotionBuffer_RecalculateAll(void)
{
    /* Forward Pass: Calculate maximum exit velocities */
    for (each block in buffer) {
        max_exit_velocity = calculate_junction_velocity(current, next);
        block->exit_velocity = min(max_exit_velocity, max_entry_velocity);
    }
    
    /* Reverse Pass: Ensure acceleration limits */
    for (each block in reverse) {
        if (exit_velocity > entry_velocity + accel * time) {
            entry_velocity = exit_velocity - accel * time;
        }
    }
    
    /* Generate S-curve profiles with optimized velocities */
    for (each block) {
        MotionMath_CalculateSCurveTiming(
            block->entry_velocity,
            block->exit_velocity,
            &block->profile
        );
    }
}
```

**Testing Strategy**:
1. Use oscilloscope to measure corner speeds
2. Verify velocity doesn't reach zero at junctions
3. Test with complex G-code (circles, spirals)
4. Compare total execution time vs Phase 2
