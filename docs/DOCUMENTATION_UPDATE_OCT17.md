     - Machine control (M3-M9, M0, M2, M30)
  3. **Testing Workflow**: 4 phases with example commands
  4. **Future Testing Scripts**: PowerShell automation

#### Building the Project Section
- Expanded with:

  - Output files explanation

#### New Section: Usage
- **Connecting to UGS**: Step-by-step connection guide
- **Basic Operation**: Common G-code examples
- **Understanding Blocking Protocol**: Critical section explaining:
  - Why pauses between moves are CORRECT
  - Benefits for testing
  - Future optimization path

## Key Documentation Themes

### 1. Production Readiness
Documentation now reflects that **Phase 1 is COMPLETE**:
- Full GRBL v1.1f protocol
- UGS connectivity verified
- Settings management operational
- Real-time position feedback working
- Blocking flow control implemented

### 2. Clear Testing Guidance
Added comprehensive testing instructions:
- UGS connection steps
- G-code command reference

### 3. Future Roadmap Clarity
Clearly separated current vs future features:
- **Current**: Simple Send-Response blocking protocol
- **Future**: Look-ahead planning + Character-Counting protocol
- Explains trade-offs and migration path

### 4. Educational Content
Documentation now explains WHY design decisions were made:
- Why blocking protocol is correct for Phase 1
- Why pauses between moves are expected
- How future optimizations will work
- What each GRBL command does

2. **Code Examples**: Real G-code snippets users can copy/paste
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Basic â†’ advanced information flow
4. **Why, Not Just How**: Explains rationale behind decisions
5. **Testing Focus**: Emphasizes what to test and expect
6. **Future Path**: Shows evolution without mixing current state
7. **Consistent Terminology**: GRBL v1.1f, UGS, blocking protocol, etc.
8. **Line Counts**: Provides scope/complexity indicators

## Next Steps for Documentation

When hardware testing completes:
1. Add **Results** section with oscilloscope captures
2. Document any issues discovered and resolutions
3. Update TODO with actual test results
4. Add troubleshooting section based on real testing
5. Create video tutorials for UGS setup

When look-ahead planning implemented:
1. Update flow control section
2. Add performance comparisons (blocking vs character-counting)
3. Document junction velocity tuning parameters
4. Add cornering accuracy test results

## Conclusion

Documentation now accurately reflects:
- **Current state**: Production-ready GRBL v1.1f with blocking protocol
- **Testing readiness**: Clear instructions for hardware validation
- **Future direction**: Look-ahead planning and continuous motion
- **User expectations**: Pauses between moves are CORRECT for Phase 1

All documentation is synchronized and ready for external review or onboarding new developers.
